# DOM-array-methods
Wealth App
Solo coded "wealth app" from Brad Traversy's 20 web projects with vanilla javascript.

Description

This app was created by Brad Travery and its from his Udemy course. This app showcases a few array methods and DOM manipulation techniques. It calls on the randomuser.me API to create a random first and last name, give them an amount of money using a random number function, then it adds the user's info to the DOM. There are five buttons, each using a different array method to add a new user, double each user's wealth, filter out users with less than one million dollars, sorts them by richest and totals all their combined wealth. I coded this project on my own then compared my code to Brad's to see a different way of doing things. This was an excellent project to practice these DOM array methods.
